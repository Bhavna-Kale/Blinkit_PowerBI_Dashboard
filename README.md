## üí° Project Goal

This project is a detailed **Business Intelligence (BI)** dashboard created using **Power BI** to analyze the operational and sales data of a quick-commerce service (e.g., Blinkit).

The primary objective was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful, **actionable insights** for business stakeholders, focusing on optimizing **sales performance, understanding demand patterns, and improving delivery efficiency.**

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

* **Delivery Efficiency:** Calculated and visualized key logistics metrics, such as **Average Delivery Time** and order fulfillment rates, highlighting areas for operational improvement.
* **Customer & Order Analysis:** Segmented orders by time of day/week to understand **peak demand cycles** and analyzed customer ordering frequency.
* **DAX Measures:** Developed advanced custom measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculating **Year-over-Year Growth**, **Average Order Value (AOV)**, and other critical financial metrics.
* **Data Modeling:** Established a robust **Star Schema** data model within Power BI to ensure fast and accurate relationships between fact and dimension tables.
